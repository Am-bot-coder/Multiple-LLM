# Orchestrating Multiple LLMs

This project demonstrates how to orchestrate multiple large language models (LLMs) to collaboratively solve complex problems. The notebook `OrchestratingMultipleLLMs.ipynb` showcases techniques for selecting, routing, and combining different LLMs based on their capabilities, using APIs and frameworks like OpenAI, LangChain, and Hugging Face.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

As no single LLM is optimal for every task, this project focuses on using the right model for the right subtask. It explores how to:

- Select LLMs based on task suitability
- Route input to the appropriate model
- Chain multiple models for compound reasoning
- Evaluate and compare model outputs

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **Model Specialization:** Use different LLMs for summarization, translation, coding, Q&A, etc.
- **Task Routing:** Dynamically assign queries based on their intent or complexity.
- **Pipeline Chaining:** Orchestrate multi-step reasoning across several models.
- **Function Calling & Tool Use:** Enable models to call structured tools or APIs.
- **Benchmarking:** Analyze performance across different LLMs for the same task.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- [Transformers (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/)
- `pydantic`, `tqdm`, `ipython`, `dotenv`

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

You can install all required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install openai langchain transformers pydantic tqdm ipython python-dotenv
